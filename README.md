Our trained model can be found in [Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13HzxPsRWdPC_CAsbvgMgU5IG_TKPVbNe/view?usp=sharing)

The PIPAL dataset can be found in [Here](https://www.jasongt.com/projectpages/pipal.html); our matched degraded images can be downloaded in [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OMtWZupCwTo_Z-lI2Gywv9Ggexi9tt6K/view?usp=sharing). Please put all images into one folder.

To train the model, please run:

>bash train.sh

To evaluate the model, please run:

>bash val.sh

To predict the quality score for an image/folder, please:

>1. put degraded images into 'data_folder/degraded' and restored images into 'data_folder/restored' (with the same file name).
>2. run: bash predict_score.sh
